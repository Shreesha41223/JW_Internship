            Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with
            larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players
            per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; professional games are played
            on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the
            other team's half of the court, within the set boundaries.
            
            Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck
            the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing
            side.
            
            The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in
            many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more
            rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports, making badminton the
            fastest racquet sport in the world. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature, and in certain
            languages the sport is named by reference to this feature (e.g., German Federball, literally feather-ball).

                <h4>Singles Rules</h4>
                <p>
                In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in their left service court
                when their score is odd. The server starts in the right service court and serves from there if their score is even.
                If their score is odd, the server starts in the left service court and serves from there. The players change ends at
                the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and
                when the leading player's score reaches 11 points.

                In doubles, each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
                shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their

                <h4>Mixed Rules</h4>
                <p>
                In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation, with the male player covering the rear court and the female player covering the front court. This formation allows the male player to utilize his typically stronger smashes from the back, while the female player can intercept and play net shots at the front. Communication and coordination between partners are crucial in mixed doubles to effectively cover the court and capitalize on attacking opportunities.
